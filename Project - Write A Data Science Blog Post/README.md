# [DSND] Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post (StackOverflow 2020)

In this project, I decided to investigate what topics or learning sources I should continue to focus on to become a good data scientist and how I can accomplish this.
Since I rely a lot on the Internet as a knowledge base in my professional environment as a software developer, I decided to use the [StackOverflow Developer Survey from Year 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020) from Kaggle to do this.

To answer my questions in a structured way, I will use the **CRISP-DM** process, which is a cross-industry process for data mining:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Prepare Data
4. Data Modeling
5. Evaluate the Results
6. Deploy

## Getting Started

Below we see the public StackOverflow survey from the year 2020 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020).

With nearly 65,000 responses fielded from over 180 countries and dependent territories, our 2020 Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from career satisfaction and job search to education and opinions on open-source software.

### Prerequisites

Thinks you have to install or installed on your working machine:

* Python 3.7
* Numpy (win-64 v1.15.4)
* Pandas (win-64 v0.23.4)
* Matplotlib (win-64 v3.0.2)
* Jupyter Notebook

### Environment:
* [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

### Installing

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or
[miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to install your packages.  
A step by step guide to install the all necessary components in Anaconda for a Windows-64 System:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
conda install -c conda-forge pandas
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

## Jupyter Notebook
* `project_so2020.ipynb`

This jupyter notebook describe the whole project from udacity, from the beginning to the end.

## Running the project

The whole project is located in the jupyter notebook file `project_so2020.ipynb` and it's include the loading, analysis and answering my business questions. In the end of each business question you will find a short conclusion and a further idea to continue my work in this jupyter notebook.
